.. image:: https://github.com/Magicbitlk/Magicbit-Arduino/raw/master/Resources/Arduino1.6.4_IDE_small.png


The open-source Arduino Software (IDE) makes it easy to write code and upload it to the board. It runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. The environment is written in Java and based on Processing and other open-source software.Arduino IDE is not only used for programme Arduino boards but also other development boards like esp32, magicbita dn so on.
Let's get some general idea about Arduino IDE preview.
Below picture shows the startup preview of the Arduino IDE. In this at the middle you have your text editor and at the top left side there is a menu bar which have several options.

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Arduino/raw/master/Resources/IDE.png

Let's look at options in the Arduino menu bar.

- File- As the name suggests you can do the documentary things with this option. You can open new sketch, close, save that sketch, open existing sketch or example sketch and change system preferences.
- Edit- With this you can change your font size, indentations and some writing options
- Sketch- This is important as compilation, uploading and library options are available in this.
- Tools- Hardware setup is done in this option. You can change the board type, programmer type and connecting port name with this and configure other hardware settings.
- Help- This option is used for connecting with Arduino references and getting help.

Below the menu bar you have some shortcut keys (command keys). First one is verify key button. By using this you can know your code is grammarly correct or not according to programming language rules. Using the upload button you can do both the compile and upload process at same time. 
The right top corner have serial monitor icon. This is very important option. This is used to communicate between Arduino IDE and your development board. You can send data to and watch the data which is sent by the development board from this. Under the serial monitor icon we can see some small icon options. This option is used to set the configurations of the new tabs and existing tabs.
At the bottom side you can see the debugging console. This shows the result of the compilation and uploading and some other messages which are very useful for debugging.

In the text editor space we can write any Arduino program. This is our playground. We can write any related code in that space. Here are two sections. One is void setup and the other one is void loop. In the void setup we write which we want to execute at the start and one time. So we write pin configurations and other library configurations in the void setup. Our main algorithm is in the void loop. As its name suggests the processor execute this loop section repeatedly at every time. So we write the things which we want to execute at every time in this section.
After writing the code go to tools->select your board type and select your port name correctly. Then click the upload button to upload the code.

***************
Examples
***************
Example 1: Blinking an LED
==========================

Introduction
------------

     In this example you are learning how to turn on and off a LED or any other actuator which can be controlled by a digital output such as relay, bulb, motor.

Learning Outcomes
------------------

 From this example, you'll get an understanding about,

-  Pin Mode
-  Digital Write
-  Delay Functions

Components
----------

- Magicbit

Theory
------

 A digital output allows you to control a voltage with an electronic device. If the device instructs the output to be high, the output will produce a voltage (generally about 5 or 3.3 volts). If the device instructs the output to be low, it is connected to ground and produces no voltage.Here Magicbit is the device and output voltage is either 3.3V for HIGH and 0V for LOW.

Methodology
-----------

 Magicbit equipped with four onboard leds in Magicbit development board, Lets select yellow LED (which is wired to D18)

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image4.png?raw=true

 By setting output state to high of LED pin will turn on the led and by setting output state to LOW will turn of LED.

Coding
------

 .. code-block:: c

     void setup(){
	pinMode(18,OUTPUT);
     }
     void loop(){
	digitalWrite(18,HIGH);
	delay(1000);
	digitalWrite(18,LOW);
	delay(1000);
     }

Explanation
-----------

 **pinMode(pin, Mode):** Configures the specified pin to behave either as an input or an output. Here we use pin as an output

 **digitalWrite(pin No, State):** Write a HIGH or a LOW value to a digital pin.Pin mode must be setup for the same pin in Setup to work this function properly.

 **delay(ms):** Pauses the program for the amount of time (in milliseconds) specified as parameter.(note 1000 milliseconds equals to one second)

**Note: Write code for a knight rider pattern using on board leds of Magicbit**


Example 2: Reading the state of a push button
=============================================

Introduction
------------
     In this example you are learning how read a digital input from something like a button & use it to turn on and off a LED or any other digital device.

Learning Outcomes
--------------------
 From this example, you'll get an understanding about,

-  Digital Read
-  IF-ELSE conditions
-  Variables

Components
-------------
- Magicbit

Theory
------------
 A digital input allows you to read digital signals. Microcontroller recognizes the signal as 1(HIGH) when the signal is close to 3.3v (or 5v depending on the microcontroller) and recognizes as 0(LOW) when the signal is close to 0v. This reading can be used in the program to do various things.  

Methodology
-----------
 Magicbit equipped with two onboard push buttons in Magicbit development board, Lets select the push button which is wired to D34. Buttons on the board are in pulled up internally (to learn more about pullups/pulldowns follow this link), which means when button is not pressed the status of the button is 1(HIGH), & when the button is pressed the status of the button is 0(LOW).

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image7.png?raw=true

 Also like in previous example we need to select an LED to indicate the change, lets select RED LED which is wired to pin D27.

 First we set the input output configurations of the Button and the LED using pinMode, in this case button is an INPUT, LED is an OUTPUT.
 Then in the loop section we check the state of the button & store it in an int type variable called buttonState (follow this link to learn more about data types in arduino).

 Then we can use the variable as the condition of the if block, and if the button is pressed, the bulb should turn on, and the button is not pressed the light should turn off. 

Coding
----------
 .. code-block:: c

     void Setup(){
	pinMode(27,OUTPUT);
	pinMode(34,INPUT);
     }
     void loop(){

      int buttonState = digitalRead(34);
      if(buttonState == LOW){
	digitalWrite(27, HIGH);
      }else{
	digitalWrite(27, LOW);
      }
     }

Explanation
--------------
 **digitalRead(pin No):** Reads the condition of the given pin and returns a digital value HIGH or LOW.

 **IF/ELSE:** Used to evaluate a digital condition, we can put a digital logic condition in then parenthesis. If the condition is true, it executes the code block in the immediate curly bracket section, if the condition is false it executes the code block in the else curly bracket. 

  if(condition){
	//Do if condition is true
  }else{
	//Do if condition is false}


**Note: Write a code to toggle an LED in the button press. LED turns on when button pressed & released, LED turns off when button is pressed & released again. (Hint: Make use of variables to ‘remember’ the state of the button press).**

Example 3: Reading an Analog Signal
===================================

Introduction
-------------

     In this example you are learning to read an analog sensor & print it on the serial console.

Learning Outcomes
------------------

 From this example, you'll get an understanding about,

-  Analog Read function


Components
-----------

- Magicbit

Theory
-------

 In real world most of the signals we encounter are analog signals (temperature, air pressure, velocity), they are continuous. But computers work on digital domain, to interact between the worlds, representing an analog signal in the digital domain is important. 
 (to read more about analog to digital conversation, follow this link)

Methodology
------------

 For this example we use the potentiometer on the Magicbit board, which is connected to pin, D39. It generates a voltage between 0 and 3.3V according to the angle of the potentiometer. 

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image1.png?raw=true

 We read the analog signal and storing it in an int type variable(0v= 0 analog value, 3.3v = 1024 analog value), sensorValue, later, we use this value to print on the serial window of arduino IDE as well as light up the  red LED(D27) if the analog value exceeds than 512.

Coding
------
 .. code-block:: c

   void setup(){
	pinMode(39,INPUT);
	pinMode(27,OUTPUT)
	Serial.begin(9600);
   }
   void loop(){
	int sensorValue = analogRead(39);
	Serial.println(sensorValue);
	
        if(sensorValue > 512){
	   digitalWrite(27,HIGH);
        }else{
	   digitalWrite(27,LOW);
        }
    }

Explanation
-----------
 **analogRead(pin No):** this reads and assigns the corresponding analog value to the left.

Activity
---------

**Note: Do the same example using the LDR on the board (D36)**

Example 4: Working with Analog Write
====================================

Introduction
---------------
     In this example you are learning how to turn on and off a LED or any other actuator which can be controlled by a digital output such as relay, bulb, motor.

Learning Outcomes
-------------------
 From this example, you'll get an understanding about,

-  Pulse Width Modulation
-  Analog Write

Components
------------

- Magicbit

Theory
-----------

 To change the brightness of a LED we could change the voltage the LED is supplied with, but in a microcontroller, ability to change the voltage (converting a digital number to an analog voltage) is limited, so a method called PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is used. What this does is pulsing on and off the pin in a high frequency. The length of the pulses creates the perception of brightness. 

 Duty cycle is a term used to describe the ratio between on and off times.

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image8.png?raw=true

 In this example higher Duty cycle gives higher brightness & lower duty cycle gives lower brightness.

Methodology
-------------
 Lets select green LED (which is wired to D16). We will use a for loop to generate the duty cycle (0 - 0% duty, 255-100% duty). And also to generate 255 cycles.

Coding
------
 .. code-block:: c

  #include <ESP32Servo.h>

  void setup(){
        pinMode(16,OUTPUT);
  }
  void loop(){
	for(int i = 0; i < 256; i++){
	analogWrite(16, i);
	delay(10);
  }

Explanation
------------
 **for(int i=0; i<256; i++):** There are 3 parameters in a for loop, first parameter we are defining a variable to store the value generated by the for loop. Second parameter specifies the condition that needs to be true to run the for loop(else it breaks out from the loop), third parameter specifies the change happens to the variable in each cycle, in this case 1, added to i. 

 **analogWrite(pin number, pwm value):** You can input the pin number you need to do pwm and then the pwm value you need to give to that pin. This assigns the corresponding duty cycle to the pin.


**Note This example we have coded to increase the brightness, write a code to do the opposite of that, to fade the brightness of the led, & put both effects together to create a beautiful fade & light up effect.**


Example 5: Using Serial Protocol
=================================

Introduction
------------
     In this example you are learning to use serial communication function.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

 From this example, you'll get an understanding about,

-  Serial Protocol usage between Magicbit & the PC


Components
----------

- Magicbit
- Computer with arduino installed

Theory
-------
 In microcontroller programming, communication between devices is essential. There are hundreds of protocols available, but most common & easy to use is Serial Protocol. Commonly used to communicate information between a microcontroller and a computer.

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image3.png?raw=true

Methodology
-----------
   
 We configure a button as the 2nd example (D34 is used). Then we initialize serial communication between the computer and Magicbit. 
 After that in the loop section if condition check if the button is pressed. If pressed, it prints “Button Pressed” on the serial console.  

 You could use the serial monitor window of arduino IDE to view the serial output

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image5.png?raw=true
 
 Then the serial console appears (you have to select the serial port number correctly, follow this link to learn how to). 

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image6.png?raw=true

 **1:** You can type in stuff here & hit enter to send data to Magicbit
 
 **2:** This area shows the data coming from Magicbit
 
 **3:** From this menu you have to select a common baudrate between the computer and the magic    bit.

Coding
------
 .. code-block:: c

     void setup(){
       pinMode(34,INPUT);
       Serial.begin(9600);
     }
     void loop(){
       if(digitalRead(34) == LOW){
         Serial.println(“Button is Pressed”);
       }
     }


Explanation
-----------
 **Serial.begin(baudrate):** Initializes a serial connection, baudrate specifies the speed of data transfer (bits per second). Standard values are 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 128000 and 25600

 **Serial.print(stuff to print):** Using this function, serial data can be sent, stuff to print can be any type of arduino variable, or even a static string.

 **Serial.println(stuff to print):** Using this function, serial data can be sent, stuff to print can be any type of arduino variable, or even a static string, this is different than Serial.print() is this always prints the content in a new line, rather than printing all in one line.

Activity
---------
**Note: do the same example using Serial.print(), observe the difference.  Create a button press counter, which displays the button press count on the serial console of arduino IDE.**



Example 6: Using the onboard OLED Screen
=========================================

Introduction

Learning Outcomes
------------------

 From this example, you'll get an understanding about,

-  Using Adafruit OLED library

Components
-----------

- Magicbit

Theory
---------
 Magicbit has a 0.96" OLED Screen which can be communicated with from I2C protocol. The display has the address, **0x3c**.

Methodology
-------------
 Adafruit OLED library(Adafruit_SSD1306 & Adafruit_GFX) is used to handle the LCD, its important to install those libraries beforehand. First we create the content we need to print onto the screen and then use display.display command to update the screen.

Coding
---------
 .. code-block:: c

  #include <Wire.h>
  #include <Adafruit_GFX.h>
  #include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>
  #define OLED_RESET 4

  Adafruit_SSD1306 display(128,64);

  void setup(){
    display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C);
    display.display();
    delay(3000);
  }


  void loop(){
    display.clearDisplay();
    display.setTextSize(2);
    display.setTextColor(WHITE);
    display.setCursor(10, 0);
    display.println("Hello");
  
    display.setTextColor(WHITE);
    display.setTextSize(1);
    display.setCursor(0, 25);
    display.println("Welcome to");
    display.println();
    display.println("Magic");
    display.println("Bit");
    display.display();
    display.clearDisplay();
  
    delay(1000);

    }

Explanation
-----------

 **display.clearDisplay():** Clears the OLED display.

 **display.setTextSize(2):** Set the font size of the text.

 **display.setCursor(0, 25):** Sets the cursor(determines where the next text will appear).

 **display.println(stuff to print):** print the data given on a new line, similar effect like Serial.println.

 **display.setTextColor(WHITE):** Sets the color of the text.

 **display.display():** Updates the changes to the screen.


**Note:: Make a program to display the ADC value of the potentiometer on the OLED display.** 



	
Example 7:  DC motor controlling
====================================

7.1 Introduction
------------------
There are many projects where we have to use motors for many purposes. All processors work under 5V or 3.3V. So their outputs are not enough to supply larger current and voltages to control motors. In this case we use an additional module to control motors. That is a motor driver. As the name suggests, every motor driver is doing the same thing. That is , controlling motors using external power sources based on microcontroller signals. These controlling signals are not constant voltage values. They are PWM(Pulse width modulation) signals. These signals are digital signals. Lot of motor drivers use the H-Bridge mechanism to control the motors. If you use an Arduino board you have to use an external motor driver to control motors. But in the Magicbit you don't want to buy any external motor controllers. Because it already has an inbuilt H-bridge motor driver. So you can directly connect motors to the Magicbit and you can play with them.

**Learning outcomes:**

•	Using inbuilt motor driver to control motors
•	Apply motor controlling process for projects

7.2 Components
----------------

•	Magicbit
•	brushed DC motors(3V or 6V)

7.3 Theory
-----------

First let's look at how this whole process is happening. We all know about that every motor needs power source to work. So if you bought 3v motor you have to supply 3V for proper working. The passing current through the motor is depend on torque of the motor. If motor axel is working freely then it gets low amount of current. If motors are in difficult condition to rotate there axel then it gets higher amount of current. To control motors we used voltage sources. Voltage sources are sources which supply any amount of current under constant voltage. So the speed of motors will depend on the voltages. If we supply high voltage then motor will work at higher RPM and vice versa. Therefore now you can understand that we can control the speed by controlling the supply voltage level. But this is an old way and it's not efficient and accurate. Modernly we use PWM pulses. PWM means pulse width modulation. In this case we generate a square wave with some constant frequency to control the motors. So the lower state of this wave is nearly zero volt (0V) and the higher state of the wave is nearly supply voltage. Therefore we are able to use our full supply voltage to control the motors. But how can we control the motor speeds using this theorem. That is very easy. If we consider one cycle (duty cycle) of the wave that includes two parts. One is the High stage part and the other one is Low stage part. Let's say High stage time duration is T1, Low stage Time duration is T2 and one cycle time duration is T. So we can simply write the equation below.

                                                                              T=T1+T2
									      
If T2=0 and T=T1,then there isn't any lower state part in every cycle. In this case motor is working with full speed. Because we always give source voltage to motor. But if T1=0 and T=T2, there is no supply voltage and current to the motor. In this case motor is fully turned off. So the speed will be zero. Let's look at another situation. Lets say T1=T2 ,then T1=T2=T/2. So at this time both time periods of high and low states are equal to every cycle. Now the average value of the wave is half of the source power. Therefore the supply voltage to the motor is half of the main supply voltage(we don't know the variation between the supply voltage and the motor speed. because it depends on your motor.therefore we can't say the motor speed will be half of the maximum speed under half of supply voltage). In this way we can get every voltage between 0 and source voltage from average voltage by changing the ratio between T1 and T2.
To measure the PWM signal average, we use some factor value called duty cycle value. This value is a percentage value of the ratio of T1 and T.

                                                                   Duty cycle=(T1/T)x100%
								   
.. image:: https://circuitdigest.com/sites/default/files/projectimage_tut/Pulse-Width-Modulation.jpg

In the microcontrollers we represent this duty cycle value from bit value. If we use 8 bits then we can get 0-255 range to represent duty cycle. In that case 255 means 100% duty cycle and 0 means 0% duty cycle and so on. Now you have some general idea about motor control signals. These PWM signals are not limit to motor controlling applications. These signals are used for many purposes. Next look at how can we use this theorem to motor controlling process. To control motors we use a microcontroller to generate PWM signals. As the introduction describes, these voltage ranges and current of the PWM signals are not sufficient to control the motors. So we used motor driver for that purpose. All we know is that motors can rotate in two opposite directions with various speeds. Because of that reason we get two outputs from the microcontroller to control motor. If we want to rotate the motor in one direction then we use one output to generate a PWM signal while the other one is in low state. If we want that motor rotates in the opposite direction, in that case we use a second output pin to generate a PWM signal while setting the low state to the first pin. Because of the lack of current and voltage of this pin outputs, we will use motor controller unit. This unit includes an H-bridge switching mechanism. Let's look at how it works.
Before moving to that part, take a look at what transistor is. Transistor is a semiconductor device which is used to control signals. There are a lot of transistor types. But every transistor works in the same principle. A transistor has three pins. One pin is used to supply the signal. These signals can be voltage or current signals. The source current is going through other pins. According to the input signal this flowing current is changing. If input signal is larger than some defined value then the passing current will be maximized and if input signal is lower than some amount, then the passing current will be nearly neglectable. So these 2 situations are known as cutoff and saturation regions of the transistor. At these stages the transistor works as a switch. So if we connect microcontroller output into the transistor input signal, then at the high digital signal transistor will be on and at the low digital signal transistor will be off. Now you have a basic idea about transistor mechanisms.

So now let's look at the H-bridge mechanism.

.. image:: https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/H-bridge-switches.png

As you can see there are four switches s1, s2, s3 and s4. These switches are actually transistors or some switching component. Let's analyse this diagram. If s1 and s4 are ON and others are OFF then, the motor will work in one direction. By changing the ON and OFF time of the S1 and S4 with some constant frequencies, we can rotate that motor with various speeds. If s3 and s2 are ON and others are OFF then the motor will go in the other direction. Also we can change the motor speed by changing the ON and OFF time of S2 and S3 switches.
If all switches are OFF or all are ON then the motor will stop.

.. image:: https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/H-bridge.png

So now you can see how switches are replaced by transistors. Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 represents S1, S2, S3 and S4 switches. In this diagram the base pin is the input signal pin of the transistor. If we supply a high state signal to that pin the transistor will saturate and that transistor acts as a closed switch (ON). Otherwise it will act as an open (OFF) switch. In this diagram there are four inputs to control for transistors. But we combine these four inputs to two inputs which satisfy the above switching conditions.

In the Magicbit it includes L110 motor driver IC which has the ability to control two motors. So it is a two channel motor driver IC. It internally connected to the esp32 processor of the Magicbit from four. M1A, M1B, M2A and M2B are the pins of the lower port of the Magicbit which are output pins of the L9110 IC.

7.4 Methodology
-----------------

Connect the motor to the M1A and M1B or M2A and M2B pins or connect two motors to the port on the left corner in the lower side of the Magicbit. Connect the Magicbit to your PC and upload the following code.


7.5 Coding
------------
.. code-block:: c

	#include <ESP32Servo.h>
	int M1A = 26; //motor drive input pins
	int M1B = 2;
	int M2A = 27;
	int M2B = 4;
	void setup() {
	  pinMode(M1A, OUTPUT); //configure as inputs
	  pinMode(M1B, OUTPUT);
	  pinMode(M2A, OUTPUT);
	  pinMode(M2B, OUTPUT);
	}
	void loop() {
	  for (int i = 0; i <= 255; i++) { //rotate both motors to direction
	    analogWrite(M1A, i);//pwm signal 
	    analogWrite(M1B, 0);
	    analogWrite(M2A, i);
	    analogWrite(M2B, 0);
	    delay(100);
	  }
	  analogWrite(M1A, 255);//stop for 1 second
	  analogWrite(M1B, 255);
	  analogWrite(M2A, 255);
	  analogWrite(M2B, 255);
	  delay(1000);
	  for (int i = 0; i <= 255; i++) { //rotate both motors to opposite direction
	    analogWrite(M1A, 0);
	    analogWrite(M1B, i);
	    analogWrite(M2A, 0);
	    analogWrite(M2B, i);
	    delay(100);
	  }
	  analogWrite(M1A, 255);//stop for 1 second
	  analogWrite(M1B, 255);
	  analogWrite(M2A, 255);
	  analogWrite(M2B, 255);
	  delay(1000);
	}

Following Blocks are available.
 
-  Digital Out
-  Digital In
-  Analog Out/PWM
-  Analog In
-  Serial Tx
-  Serial Rx
-  Servo
-  Display
-  Buzzer
-  Motor
-  DHT11
-  NeoPixel
-  Ultrasonic

This block set enables you to control individual pins of the device from the playground. The functionality of each block is described below:

How Configure Blocks
======================

Every block has a property called Device ID where you need to specify to which device this block belongs to. This is important because you will be working with multiple devices in a typical IoT project. You can find device ID from magicblocks device manager.

Digital Out
-----------

.. image:: Images/digitalOut.PNG


This block is used to set a digital output pin to 1 or 0 based on the input. An input of 1 or true will make the configured pin go HIGH and vice versa

- Configuration
    - Pin: pin number of the Digital pin to write to. Available pins can be selected from dropdown list. 
    - Name: Any name desired
- Input
    - value to be written to the pin. Accepts 1 (true) or 0 (false) eg: {"payload": 1} 

Digital In
----------
.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/digitalIn.PNG?raw=true


This block will read Input status of a pin. There are two methods to get input 
1. Poll - Block need to triggered to get input status. Any input will serve as a trigger. (eg:inject block)
2. Interrupt - If there is any change of pin state of Magicbit block will output the current state
Input status can be passed to a another block or viewed on the debug window.


- Configuration:
    - Pin: pin number of the digital pin to read .Select from drop down list
    - Name: Any name desired
    - Method: Poll/Interrupt
- Input
    - Any input. Used as a trigger
- Output
    - Value of the pin as 1 or 0 in the following format and the pin number as the topic

Analog Out
----------


.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/analogOut.PNG?raw=true

This block used to set PWM to pins of Magicbit. Value should be in range of 0-255. Inject block or output of a another block can be used to set the value.

- Configuration:
    - Pin: pin number of the to set PWM. Select from drop down list
    - Name: Any name desired

- Input
    - Inject block or any block. Input value should be in range of 0-255

Analog In
---------

.. image:: https://github.com/magicbitlk/Magicbit-Magicblocks.io/blob/master/Images/analogIn.PNG?raw=true

This block will read analog value of the ADC pin of the module. Similar to the digital in block you need to set method to read the value. Any input sent to the block will serve as the trigger.

1. Poll - Block need to triggered to get input status. Any input will serve as a trigger. (eg:inject block)
2. Interrupt - If there is any change greater or less than threshold value of Magicbit block will output the analog value

- Configuration:
    - Pin: pin number of the analog pin to read (Required)
    - Name: Any name desired
    - Method: Poll/Interrupt
    - Threshold: If interrupt method selected value return from output if there is any change greater or less than this value


- Input
    - Any input. Used as a trigger
- Output
    - Value of the pin from 0 to 4096 (12bit ADC)  {"payload": 965}

Control LED form web dashboard
=============================================
Introduction
------------------
There are 2 main methods of achieving this goal.

- By using Inject Block.
- By using Dashboard Switch.

From both of this methods we discuss about second method .

Methodology
------------------
- Setting Up the Switch Block
Drag & drop the Switch block from the dashboard nodes section to the Flow.
